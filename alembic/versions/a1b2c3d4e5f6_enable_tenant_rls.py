"""enable tenant row-level security

Revision ID: a1b2c3d4e5f6
Revises: ff9ae8dcd7f7
Create Date: 2026-06-07

Adds Postgres Row-Level Security to every public table with a `tenant_id`
column. After this migration:

  * A role `app_user` exists with CRUD privileges on tenant-scoped tables.
  * Every tenant-scoped table has RLS enabled + FORCED.
  * A policy `tenant_isolation` filters rows to those matching the runtime
    setting `app.tenant_id`. Connections that have not set it see no rows.
  * Owner role and superuser are subject to the same policy (FORCE),
    EXCEPT roles explicitly granted `BYPASSRLS`.

⚠️  BREAKING for services that currently connect as the table owner and do
    NOT set `app.tenant_id` before querying. Affected services:
      - workflow-runtime
      - flow-builder
      - kb-backend
      - release-worker
      - audit-bridge / audit-consumer
    Each must adopt `services.shared.db_context.tenant_scoped_db()` or set
    `SET LOCAL app.tenant_id = ...` per request before its routes return.

Emergency rollback: `alembic downgrade -1`. Or grant BYPASSRLS to the owner
role: `ALTER ROLE <owner> BYPASSRLS;` (then revoke when migration done).

# Discover every public table that has a tenant_id column, then for each:
#   - GRANT CRUD to app_user
#   - ENABLE + FORCE row-level security
#   - install tenant_isolation policy
#
# Policy logic:
#   USING — read filter. Row is visible iff its tenant_id matches the
#           runtime setting `app.tenant_id`. NULLIF('', '...') handles the
#           unset case so we get NULL (no rows) instead of an error from
#           casting '' to uuid.
#   WITH CHECK — write filter. INSERT/UPDATE must also match. Prevents a
#           caller from smuggling a different tenant_id into a row.
#
# `current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)` — the second arg `true` means
# missing_ok: returns '' if unset rather than raising. We translate to NULL
# via NULLIF so the comparison fails cleanly (no rows).

"""Alembic migration end-to-end tests.

These exist because the test harness in test_auth_api_smoke uses psycopg2
(sync driver), but production migrate runs through asyncpg (async). Some
SQL patterns work on one and fail on the other — most notably asyncpg's
"cannot insert multiple commands into a prepared statement" rejection of
semicolon-separated statements in a single `op.execute()`.

This file runs the actual migrations through asyncpg, so the dev loop
catches that class of failure on `pytest`, not on `docker compose up`.

Scenarios:

  1. Fresh DB → upgrade head succeeds, every migration runs.
  2. DB with SQL init scripts applied (release-init.sql) → env.py's stamp
     fallback kicks in, only newer migrations run, no DuplicateTable.

For each scenario:

  - Postgres testcontainer per session (reused with the auth-api fixture).
  - subprocess `alembic upgrade head` against the container DSN.
  - Assert exit 0 + alembic_version row matches the latest revision.

Why subprocess instead of importing alembic.command? Production runs
alembic as a CLI invocation from a sibling container. Test the same code
path the migrate service uses, including env.py module loading.

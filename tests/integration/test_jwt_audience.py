"""End-to-end JWT audience validation tests.

Verifies the audience-validation slice of P1 #7:

  * Keycloak issues tokens with `aeroflow-backend`, `auth-api`,
    `release-worker` in the `aud` claim (driven by audience mappers
    installed via infra/keycloak/setup-audience-mappers.sh).
  * Kong's aeroflow-jwks plugin rejects a token if its `aud` doesn't
    match the per-route audience config (set by infra/kong/kong-setup.sh).

This test does NOT cover the grace_period behavior on JWKS rotation —
that needs Keycloak admin API to actually rotate keys + carefully timed
assertions. Run the procedural test in
docs/auth-runbook.md "JWKS rotation grace period" for that.

Requires the full live stack:

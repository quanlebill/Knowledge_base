# Knowledge Hub — API Contract

Three inner tabs: **DATABASE**, **QDRANT**, **NEO4J**.

---

## DATABASE tab

### GET /api/knowledge/documents/:id/chunks

Called when the user selects a Gold-layer document (non-Warehouse) to inspect its chunks.

#### Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": "CHUNK_01",
    "title": "Deployment & Failover Architecture",
    "text": "Short preview text...",
    "versions": [
      {
        "version_number": "v1.2",
        "create_at": "2026-05-23 15:30:10 UTC",
        "status": "Active",
        "embedding_models": "text-embedding-3-small (1536d)",
        "entities": ["GlobalCorp", "Failover Cluster"],
        "intent": "Explain multi-cluster failover latency parameters",
        "text": "Full chunk text content..."
      }
    ]
  }

```

The UI renders a left panel (chunk list) and a right panel (selected version detail with entities, intent word map, and version text).

## NEO4J tab

No HTTP calls. The query builder constructs a Cypher string client-side using `buildCypher(startNode, steps)` and displays it as read-only output. The graph visualization is rendered from `FALLBACK_NODES`, `FALLBACK_EDGES`, and `FALLBACK_REL_LABELS` static data.
